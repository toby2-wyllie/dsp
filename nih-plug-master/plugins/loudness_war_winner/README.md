## Download

You can download the development binaries for Linux, Windows and macOS from the
[automated

page. Or if you're not signed in on GitHub, then you can also find the latest nightly
build [here](https://nightly.link/robbert-vdh/nih-plug/workflows/build/master).

On macOS you may need to [disable
Gatekeeper](https://disable-gatekeeper.github.io/) as Apple has recently made it
more difficult to run unsigned code on macOS.

Winner as follows:
